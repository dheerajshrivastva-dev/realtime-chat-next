I need a resume to find my new work

also I am two tear expreance in single company from start of my career

and I ahve thse skills

okay I am a fullstack developer but I have worked (expreance) in the favour of front end, it include React, React-native, some of (view) etc for for BE part I get some time to work on some API creation in existing project which has micro service type setup with node and one service with grapgql then also had some expreance with CRM tools like ZOHO, I also created a proxy server to catch API and keep count of API calls with node and Redis also write script with python. I created my personal project with express and used MySQL as reletional database and created realtime chat API with react and socket.io from scratch also build authentication using cookies and JWT tokens (it was not great thow but it worked) then worked on my personal project with NEXT.js used some tech like Upstash for redis and Pusher for realtime chat. and most of them were with Typescript as well
for Frontend work
I am very good with CSS and know some advance feature like keyframes and all, I am good with layout design ( but lots of thing I can learn for css ) also use some bootstrap and has better compatibility with Tailwind css ( but just more than beginner level) But I have worked with Styled component as more than intermediate level
For HTML i know some advance tags but mostly used AI for it (not remember any of those)
for framework I am proficient with React and React-native (I can create project from scratch) I am confident but don't know what question I will get asked. I have worked with Js and Typescript as well. For react native I was mostly worked on android part so I have not experience with IOS because I do not have mac-book but I can work if I had one. For react and react native I am confidant that I can get started with any project and start working in a day. I understand how it can be complicated and how much it can get so I know my way with this stack. debugging is interesting I do not get bored very easily. and I have also worked on Vue,js but as beginner level
I have also worked on figma and I have some understanding around. I can create any icon if I see in svg. but creating from scratch (like new) is not my forte.
and upon all I have verry good expreance with git and github, jira, slack etc
and before starting working I was full time student in engineering with ECE but I focused on CSE most time, I also cleared infosys coding chalanged with solving 70% question in DSA (medium to advance) I have good question solving expreance on leet code etc.
So what I can show in my resume and what I should focus so I can get new another job/s
